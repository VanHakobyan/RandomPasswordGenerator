//6-Length password
Console.WriteLine(password);

//for exemple 8b05f7

<p>A <b>random password generator</b> is <a href="/wiki/Computer_software" class="mw-redirect" title="Computer software">software</a> program or <a href="/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a> device that takes input from a <a href="/wiki/Random" class="mw-redirect" title="Random">random</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pseudo-random" class="mw-redirect" title="Pseudo-random">pseudo-random</a> number generator and automatically generates a <a href="/wiki/Password" title="Password">password</a>. Random passwords can be generated manually, using simple sources of randomness such as dice or coins, or they can be generated using a computer.</p>


<p>While there are many examples of "random" password generator programs available on the Internet, generating randomness can be tricky and many programs do not generate random characters in a way that ensures strong security. A common recommendation is to use <a href="/wiki/Open_source" class="mw-redirect" title="Open source">open source</a> security tools where possible, since they allow independent checks on the quality of the methods used. Note that simply generating a password at random does not ensure the password is a strong password, because it is possible, although highly unlikely, to generate an easily guessed or cracked password. In fact there is no need at all for a password to have been produced by a perfectly random process: it just needs to be sufficiently difficult to guess.</p>
